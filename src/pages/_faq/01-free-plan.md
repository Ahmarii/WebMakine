title: Do you have a free plan?
---
We do have a free plan, which is the default plan that you obtain when install the application for Slack.
No credit card required is required for the free plan, but it is limited to a single user.
Due to its limitations, this plan is intended for people evaluating the product.
If you want to unleash the full potential of GraphMe and collaborate with your organization, please switch to a paid plan.
