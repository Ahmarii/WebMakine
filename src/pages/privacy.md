Last updated: March 2023

This privacy policy explains which data we collect about you and how we use it.
It also explains your rights about this data and how to exercise them.
By using our service, you accept this privacy policy.
If you are in disagreement with it, please do not use our service and contact us to get your data deleted.

## Preamble

When designing GraphMe, we took privacy very seriously from the beginning.
No company wants to risk compromising information by sharing it with a third party service that is spying on it.
That is why we collect only the very minimal amount of information needed to keep the product running, and nothing more.
You are not the product, GraphMe is!

## Information you provide to us

**Account information:**
When you install the app, we have access to your identity (but not your email address).
We also get access to information about the Slack workspace you are a member of (team name, enterprise name if it is an enterprise grid install).
When you sign up, you are redirected to Slack where you have to give your consent for us to access this data.

**Content submitted through our service:**
When using our service, you voluntarily store content into it.
It can be via our Web console or via the application for Slack.
This includes connections and graphs.

**Information from Slack:**
Our service listens to some events from Slack.
This includes reactions to commands, interactivity that result from it, and lifecycle of the application for Slack.
When you install the application for Slack, you are redirected to Slack where you have to give your consent for us to access this data.

**Information from Grafana:**
When a request is sent to the instance of Grafana you configured, we access information such as configured dashboards, their panels, and rendered graphs.
While we have access to data stored in Grafana, we do not process any personal information that might be stored there.

**Payment information:**
We collect billing information, such as a billing contact, when you subscribe to a paid plan.
You also provide payment information, such as card details, which are processed by our payment provider.

## Information we collect automatically

**Graphs:**
For every graph request sent to our app, we store rendered graphs permanently in S3.

**Usage statistics:**
We keep track of every command that was sent to our service.
It includes metadata such as the user ID, channel ID and command issued.

**Website statistics:**
Our websites contain a privacy-preserving tracking code.
We collect data about which pages are visited, referrals, entry and exit pages, time spent, device type, browser type and country.
It does not rely on any cookies to collect data, meaning individual users are not tracked.

**Logs and metrics:**
We collect technical data about every interaction with our service.
This may include your operating system, device type, browser type, IP address, time of access, loading time, HTTP status code and crash reports.

## How we use collected information

**To provide the service:**
First and foremost, we use aforementioned collected data to provide you with a service.

**To communicate with you about the service:**
We may use collected data to send you emails or Slack messages about your service usage.
For example, we may send you notifications when you reached a quota, or if your payment was declined.

**For research and development:**
We may use collected data for analytics purposes.
This allows us to better understand how you use our service, and to improve it.

**To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights:**
Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.
