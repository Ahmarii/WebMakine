# Privacy policy

:::note
Last updated: March 2023
:::

This privacy policy explains which data we collect about you and how we use it.
It also explains your rights about this data and how to exercise them.
By using our service, you accept this privacy policy.
If you are in disagreement with it, please do not use our service and contact us to get your data deleted.

## Preamble

When designing GraphMe, we took privacy very seriously from the beginning.
No company wants to risk compromising information by sharing it with a third party service that is spying on it.
That is why we collect only the very minimal amount of information needed to keep the product running, and nothing more.
You are not the product, GraphMe is!

## Which data we collect

**Account information:**
When you install the application, we get access to your identity and the identity of the workspace the application has been installed in.
When you subscribe to a plan, we get access to billing information (name, email address, billing address).
Account information is stored until your account is closed.
Billing information may be stored undefinitely when necessary for regulatory or compliance purposes.

**Content submitted through our service:**
When using our service, you voluntarily store content into it, such as connection information, queries and graphs.
It can be via our Web console or via the application for Slack.
Interactions from users may also result in some content being generated, such as graphs.
We keep track of every command that was sent to our service.
It includes metadata such as the user ID, channel ID and command issued.
Content submitted through our service is stored until you voluntarily choose to delete it (when applicable), or until your account is closed.

**Information from Slack:**
Our service listens to some events from Slack.
This includes reactions to commands, interactivity that result from it, and lifecycle of the application for Slack.
When you install the application for Slack, you are redirected to Slack where you have to give your consent for us to access this data.
The token associated with your installation of GraphMe is stored until you uninstall the application, or until your account is closed.
Other information obtained from Slack is processed in-memory and not persisted.

**Information from Grafana:**
When a request is sent to the instance of Grafana you configured, we access information such as configured dashboards and their panels.
While we have access to data stored in Grafana, we do not process any personal information that might be stored there.
Information obtained from Grafana is processed in-memory and not persisted.

**Website statistics:**
Our websites contain a privacy-preserving tracking code.
We collect data about which pages are visited, referrals, entry and exit pages, time spent, device type, browser type and country.
It does not rely on any cookies to collect data, meaning individual users are not tracked.
Website statistics are anonymous and may be stored undefinitely.

**Logs and metrics:**
We collect technical data about every interaction with our service.
This may include your operating system, device type, browser type, IP address, time of access, loading time, HTTP status code and crash reports.
Logs and metrics may be stored up to one year.

## How we use collected data

**To provide the service:**
First and foremost, we use aforementioned collected data to provide you with a service.

**To communicate with you about the service:**
We may use collected data to send you emails or Slack messages about your service usage.
For example, we may send you notifications when you reached a quota, or if your payment was declined.

**For research and development:**
We may use collected data for analytics purposes.
This allows us to better understand how you use our service, and to improve it.

**To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights:**
Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.
