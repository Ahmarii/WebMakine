# Datadog integration

GraphMe supports [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com) as a time series database.

## Configure connection

To configure a connection with Datadog, you will need an application key and an API key.
Instructions to obtain them are available in [Datadog's own documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/).
